RefDoc Rationale
----------------

You often need to write by hand a code file with declarations.

This in turn leaves behind the original jsDoc documentation.

Copying it over by hand is possible, but keeping it in sync with the source is a nightmare.

This project implements documentation by reference, so you can re-generate documentation in your final
declarations file whenever the source changes.
